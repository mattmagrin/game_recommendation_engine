# game_recommendation_engine
Built to help gamers maximize hours of fun and save on new purchases


## Project Overview

* **Understanding the problem faced by Brazilians:* According to a survey by TechNET Immsersive, the games segment is valued at more than US$ 170 billion, greater than the music and film industry combined. A relevant part of this market resides in Brazil, where thousands of fans face high direct conversion values, especially considering the value of a AAA launch in relation to the minimum wage. Thus, it is evident how the average Brazilian has no money to spend on games that will not be converted into hours of fun.
* **Solution developed:* Thinking about this problem, I created a complete pipeline, from problem formulation to deployment, returning only recommended games and being able to be filtered by platform, all based on data. To do this, we went through several steps: scraping, data processing, modeling, optimization, until reaching the final solution that was hosted on heroku, helping me a lot to decide which product to buy.
