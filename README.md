# game_recommendation_engine
Built to help gamers maximize hours of fun and save on new purchases


## Project Overview

* **Understanding the problem faced by Brazilians:**  A relevant part of the gaming market resides in Brazil, where thousands of fans face high direct conversion values from US Dollars to Brazilian Real, especially considering the value of a AAA game in relation to the minimum wage. Thus, it is evident how the **average Brazilian has no money to spend on games that will not be converted into hours of fun.**
* **Solution developed:** Thinking about this problem, I created a complete pipeline, from problem formulation to deployment, returning only recommended games and being able to be filtered by platform, all based on data. To do this, we went through several steps: scraping, data processing, modeling, optimization, until reaching the final solution that was hosted on heroku, helping me a lot to decide which product to buy.
